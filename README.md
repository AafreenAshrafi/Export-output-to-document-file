Tesla is coming to your country soon and you are responsible for doing registration for advanced booking by the customers.     
Part A: Create a console based application that accepts details like Name, Mobile Number, Age and City of a customer and
then export these details into one of the 2 formats, depending on user’s choice - “plain text” or “PDF”.   

Part B: Make the code extensible so that it is easy to ‘plug in’ a new format called ‘foobar’ without making changes to the application 
code.

Note:
 The file may not be able to browse but it will read the file in console. For all content type.
